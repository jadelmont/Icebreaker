    <h2>Equilibrium</h2>
    <h2>Why Are Glaciers Melting?</h2>
    <p>Glaciers are melting primarily due to human activities that increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun and cause global temperatures to rise. As a result, glaciers and ice sheets are melting at an accelerated rate, contributing to sea level rise and disrupting ecosystems. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes are major contributors to this problem.</p>
    <h2>What We Can Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use public transportation, bike, or walk.</li>
        <li>Support renewable energy like solar and wind.</li>
        <li>Save energy at home and work.</li>
        <li>Support policies to reduce greenhouse gases.</li>
        <li>Teach others about climate change.</li>
